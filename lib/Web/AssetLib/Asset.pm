=head1 NAME

Web::AssetLib::Asset - a representation of a particular asset in your library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $asset = Web::AssetLib::Asset->new(
        type         => 'javascript',
        input_engine => 'LocalFile',
        rank         => -100,
        input_args => { path => "your/local/path/jquery.min.js", }
    );

=head1 ATTRIBUTES
 
=head2 type (required)
 
File type string. Currently supports: js, javascript, css, stylesheet, jpeg, jpg

=head2 input_engine
 
string; partial class name that will match one of the provided input_engines for your library (defaults to "LocalFile") 

=head2 rank
 
number; Assets added to bundles will be exported in the order in which they are added. If an
asset should be exported in a different order, provide a rank.  Lower numbers will 
result in the asset being compiled earlier, and higher numbers will result in the asset
being compiled later.  (defaults to 0)

=head2 input_args
 
hashref; a place to store arguments that the various input plugins may 
require for a given asset (see input plugin docs for specific requirements)

=head2 isPassthru
 
boolean; assets marked isPassthru will not be minified or concatenated

=head2 default_html_attrs
 
hashref; provides html attribute defaults for C<< as_html() >>

=head1 METHODS

=head2 set_digest

    $asset->set_digest( $digest );
 
Stores the digest in the Asset object. (It is required that this value be set, 
if writing your own input engine.)

=head2 set_contents

    $asset->set_contents( $contents );
 
Stores the file contents in the Asset object. (It is required that this value be set, 
if writing your own input engine.)

=head2 fingerprint

    my $fingerprint = $asset->fingerprint();
 
(Somewhat) unique identifier for asset, created by concatenating and hashing: type, input_engine, and input_args.
Helpful to identify asset uniqueness prior to opening and reading the file.

=head2 digest

    my $digest = $asset->digest();
 
Truly unique identifier for asset - an MD5 file digest. Only available after the 
file has been opened and read (compile() has been called on asset), otherwise returns undef.

=head2 as_html

    my $html_tag = $asset->as_html( html_attrs => { async => 'async' } );
 
Returns an HTML-formatted string linking to asset's output location.  Only available after the 
file has been opened and read (compile() has been called on asset), otherwise returns undef.
